Customization and the flow of the Project:

I created a shortcode function named "[data_external]" in functions.php on line 59 - 113 to generate the top 10 live sport/odd through https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports?apiKey=9e778e40305290e267c9662a53e19a42 as instructed.
This shortcode can be use on different pages on the application. Basically, this shortcode was only used on the front page/landing page of the application.

I also created a shortcode function named "[filter_table]" in functions.php on line 125 - 197 to generate a filter based on Region, Sport and Market for the top 10 through â–ª https://api.the-odds-api.com/v3/odds/?apiKey=9e778e40305290e267c9662a53e19a42&sport={sport}&region=
{region}&mkt={mkt} as instructed. This shortcode can be use on different pages on the application.

Lastly: I created a bet calculator with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS code can be found on the page and can also be used on the different page of the application except the JS which i implemented/written through the use of 
"Insert Headers and Footers Plugin" and the Code can also be found by clicking on Settings->Insert Headers and Footers on admin backend 

Note: The CSS customization for the shortcodes stated above can be found in Appearance->Customization->Additional CSS on the application backend
